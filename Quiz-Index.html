    <h5>This page will help you determine which Programing Langauage best fits <strong>You.</strong></h5>
    <p>A programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks. The term programming language usually refers to high-level languages, such as BASIC, C, C++, COBOL, Java, FORTRAN, Ada, and Pascal.</p>

          <div id="toggleText1" style="display: none"><h4>C#</h4>
          <p>C# syntax is highly expressive, yet it is also simple and easy to learn. As an object-oriented language, C# supports the concepts of encapsulation and inheritance.</p>
          <p>The curly-brace syntax of C# will be instantly recognizable to anyone familiar with C, C++ or Java. Developers who know any of these languages are typically able to begin to work productively in C# within a very short time.</p>
          <p>C# makes it easy to develop software components through several innovative language constructs</p>

          <div id="toggleText2" style="display: none"><h4>JavaScript</h4>
          <p>JavaScript is a programming language that started off simply as a mechanism to add logic and interactivity to an otherwise static Netscape browser. In the years since its introduction, it has not only supplanted a variety of other competing languages and technologies to become the standard for browser-based programming, but it has also expanded beyond the client space to become a dominant language on the server side, as well.</p>

          <div id="toggleText3" style="display: none"><h4>Python</h4>
          <p>Python is a general-purpose programming language, which is another way to say that it can be used for nearly everything. Most importantly, it is an interpreted language, which means that the written code is not actually translated to a computer-readable format at runtime. Whereas, most programming languages do this conversion before the program is even run. This type of language is also referred to as a "scripting language" because it was initially meant to be used for trivial projects.
